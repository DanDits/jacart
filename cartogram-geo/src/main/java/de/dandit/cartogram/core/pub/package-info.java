 * Published interfaces/classes that offer injection points/hooks to modify behavior and implementation.
 * The goal is one the one hand to avoid having third party dependencies for this project and
 * on the other hand offer clients a flexible way to use their own (third party) dependencies to perform
 * some operations like logging and fast-fourier transformation in better performing and fitting style.
